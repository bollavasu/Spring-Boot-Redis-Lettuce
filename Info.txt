We need the following for Lettuce Redis client
1)We don't need any Lettuce maven dependency in pom, because Spring Boot 2.0 default Redis client is Lettuce
  if we have Redis dependency (spring-boot-starter-data-redis) in pom, it is enough
2)Lettuce connection pool details are mentioned in application.properties
3)We use RedisTemplate, StringRedisTemplate to connect with Redis
  We don't need any configuration class to get RedisTemplate
  
  
mvn clean install

mvn spring-boot:run
